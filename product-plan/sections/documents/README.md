# Documents

## Overview

Centralized document management section for browsing, searching, and downloading all generated PDFs across the system. Provides a unified view of Purchase Order PDFs, Inspection Briefs, Shipping Manifests, and Packing Lists with filtering and search capabilities. Each document captures a snapshot of source data at generation time for historical accuracy.

## User Flows

- View all generated documents in a searchable, filterable table
- Filter by document type (Purchase Order, Inspection Brief, Shipping Manifest, Packing List)
- Filter by date range
- Search by reference number, supplier name, or content
- Sort by date, name, type, or size
- Preview document (opens in new tab or modal)
- Download document to local machine
- Navigate to source record (PO, Inspection, or Transfer)
- Delete document with confirmation
- View document history for a specific entity

## Design Decisions

- Documents capture immutable snapshots at generation time
- Each document type has distinct icon and color badge
- Summary cards provide quick overview of document counts
- Pagination default: 25 per page
- Delete requires confirmation with warning about permanence

## Data Used

**Entities:** `GeneratedDocument`, `DocumentsSummary`, `PODocumentSnapshot`, `InspectionBriefSnapshot`, `TransferDocumentSnapshot`, `PackingListDocumentSnapshot`

**From global model:**
- PurchaseOrder (source for PO PDFs)
- Inspection (source for inspection briefs)
